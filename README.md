Installing
----------
You need to have `libhiredis` pre-installed. You can fetch the latest version
from https://github.com/antirez/hiredis.git.

    git clone https://github.com/seppo0010/phpiredis.git
    cd phpiredis

On some installs, you might need to install `php-dev`:

    sudo apt-get install php5-dev

Configure and build the extension:

    phpize
    ./configure --enable-phpiredis --with-hiredis-dir=/usr/local
    make

Copy the extension (modules/phpiredis.so) to your php extensions directory and
edit your php.ini to load by default.

Run the tests and [create an issue][] on github if some of the tests fail.

    make test

  [create an issue]: http://github.com/seppo0010/phpiredis/issues

Usage
-----
To connect to the redis server just call `phpiredis_connect` with the server ip
as the first parameter:

    $link = phpiredis_connect('127.0.0.1');

You can also specify a port as a second parameter, but by default it will use
redis default (6379):

    $link = phpiredis_connect('127.0.0.1', 6380);

You can execute commands with:

    phpiredis_command($link, 'DEL test');
    phpiredis_command($link, 'SET test 1');

Or even multiple commands with:

    phpiredis_multi_command($link, array('DEL test', 'SET test 1', 'GET test'));

If you need a binary safe command you must use the following:

    phpiredis_command_bs($link, array('DEL','test'));

__Important:__ Note that each argument is an element in an array.
